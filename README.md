# Face Detection Application using Custom Cascade Classifier Algorithm using OpenCV

## Introduction

Face detection is categorized in object detection applications. For OpenCV, face detection has two main algorithms which are both regarded boosted cascade of weak classifiers or cascade classifiers for short. The main algorithms include: [LBP (Local Binary Pattern)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_binary_patterns) and [Haar Cascade Classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar-like_feature). Both have their strengths and weaknesses and the table below shows them.
|Features|LBP|Haar Features|
|--------|---|-------------|
|**Output format**|Integers|Floating points|
|**Speed**|Fast|Slow|
|**Accuracy**|Less accurate than Haar features|More accurate than LBP|
|**Training time**|Fast|Slow|

I will be sticking to the Haar Cascade Classifier for this project due to its accuracy. OpenCV already supplies users with their own Haar Cascade Classifier but we will be making a custom one from scratch.

## Theory

Quoting [OpenCV's page](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d28/tutorial_cascade_classifier.html) on the theory behind Haar feature-based cascade classifiers:
> Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001. It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.

I have gathered the positive and negative images required to train the cascade classifier from the internet and the positive images and the negative images were 100 each.

The video below describes the theory behind the Haar feature-based cascade classifiers (Viola Jones Algorithm):

Below is the main idea of how everything works and why some of the files necessary are present:

## Training

Training is split into two datasets: positive and negative pictures. Positive pictures are the ones that we want to train the data on (faces) and negative pictures are the ones we want to avoid. For negative pictures, we just need to loop through `neg.txt` which was generated by the `generate_negative_files()` function inside `functions.py`. For the positive pictures on the other hand, annotations are needed and luckily the work of days has been made easy by an OpenCV console application `opencv_annotations.exe` to generate a `pos.txt` first and then it is entered through `opencv_createsamples.exe` to get a `pos.vec` which is a vector file that is ready for training. Finally, fine tuning of the parameters in `opencv_traincascade.exe` will do the training given the number of samples to train which was 10 times. Training on positive images is demonstrated in the [training video](https://github.com/muthanii/face-detection-opencv/blob/main/training.mp4).

## Result

The custom cascade classifier is not the best one out there due to the limited amount of positive images which are 100 images. More images, more annotations and more training samples whill lead to a more accurate results. The end result of my own custom cascade classifier can be seen in [result video](https://github.com/muthanii/face-detection-opencv/blob/main/media/results.mp4). We have to note that although there is a lot of noise in my custom cascade classifier, but the green box that was surrounding my face was almost always there.
